# Elder-Fraud-Detection

Elders are a particularly appealing target for payment fraudsters, 
owing to their greater trustworthiness than the younger population.
Many of them are unaware of and have limited knowledge on
how to use digital payment methods. This pandemic has compelled
many people to switch to digital payment systems without properly
comprehending the system, making them even more vulnerable to
fraud.
It is now exceedingly difficult to identify such instances. When
bankers speak with consumers, they listen for clues of such attacks
in the dialogue. Many clients are hesitant to confess that they have
been harmed, making it extremely rare for them to come forward
and report such events to the bank directly. Elders frequently are
unaware that they can seek assistance from a bank.
The goal of this study is to detect the possibility of such scams
directly from transaction data, without consulting bankers or customers.
The method can be used to not just contact customers who
may have been victims of an attack, but also to prevent fraudulent
transactions from being completed.
Our project is a binary classisfication type of problem which
classifies the insatance into fraud and non-fraud.
